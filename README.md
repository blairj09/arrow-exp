# Apache Arrow Experiments

This repository looks at using the [arrow R
package](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) to work with data that's larger than
RAM. Daily builds of the arrow package can be installed on macOS and Windows
with:

```r
install.packages("arrow", repos="https://dl.bintray.com/ursalabs/arrow-r")
```
